<h1>Natural Resources</h1>

Tricell resolves challenges in the sustainable and 
profitable use of renewable natural resources in 
four phenomenon-based research programmes that 
steer research in accordance with our strategy.
<p />
The programmes build and develop cooperation with 
different stakeholders using such means as round table 
discussions. Furthermore, the programmes open up 
new connections inside Tricell by bringing specialists 
and expertise together and by supporting 
multidisciplinary researcher networks.

<b>Water, Air, and Soil</b><br />
- Water is one of the most important natural resources 
flowing from forests.
<p />
- Soil provides nutrients, water, oxygen and heat to 
natural land areas.
<p />
- Air is a third critical resource for humans, plants, 
animals and all other organisms within a natural area.
