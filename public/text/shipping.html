<b>Moving technology supply chain to the fast lane</b>
A gadget’s quality or innovation may not matter if it can’t reach the 
market quickly or before the competition due to shipping delays. 
Speed through the supply chain can lead to unprecedented gains 
for technology companies, not only for their products, but also top-
line growth. Nearly 8 in 10 companies with high-performing supply 
chains achieve revenue growth higher than the average within their 
industries.

Over the last 2 years, the perception of supply chains 
has changed. Logistics has gone from backroom talks to 
being a constant topic in board meetings. A fast supply
chain has become a competitive advantage for technology 
companies, helping boost market share and customer 
loyalty.
